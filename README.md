How to visualize protein segments from the human proteome using Colab:

1. Open https://colab.research.google.com/ in a new tab or window. You may need to log in to your google account.
2. From the "open notebook" menu select "GitHub".
3. Enter github URL: "moses-lab/pLM-Visualization/".
4. Click on the notebook "/pLM-Visualization/human_proteome_segments_colab.ipynb".
5. Run each block of code by clicking on the top left hand corner "play" button.
6. Run the top block of code first.
7. Run the second block of code to generate the figure. On the top right corner of the figure there is an interactive menu where you can download a .png of the figure directly to your computer.
8. Run the third block of code to save an interactive .html of the figure to colab.
9. To download this plot from colab to your computer, click on the file folder icon on the left and you should be able to see your html file. Click on the 3 vertical dots directly to the right of the file name and select "Download". If the hteml file does not appear immediately, click on the refresh button in the file folder sub menu (just below the "Files"). html files generated in this colab session might be deleted from colab when the window is closed.
10. Re-run the second and third block of code to generate new figures and new html files.
